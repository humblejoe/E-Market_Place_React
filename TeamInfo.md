Project Title: The Gadget Zone - Ecommerce Websites for Electronic Gadgets
 
Project Summary:

The project will be focused on creating an ecommerce website hosting electronic gadgets with the facility to browse through the products and making purchases. It will have multiple screens like home page, product description page, cart details, etc. The website will facilitate saving the cart items for someone who wants to continue later. It will also allow saving customer information for new and existing customers. The product description page will also show similar products on the basis of attributes and also products bought by other customers who had bought the displayed item. The dataset used in the project will be taken from the website, dataworld.com and will resemble a typical ecommerce data.

A creative component of our website will be the projected satisfaction for customer (for the existing customers only, who have previously bought something). The reviews of the items show a general satisfaction which does not contain a personal component depending on who is buying. This feature will incorporate a personal aspect by using the attributes of the product, their reviews given by the user and applying supervised/unsupervised machine learning models to predict the rating the customer will give as a measure of the satisfaction of the particular user. Thus, instead of showing what the general review is for the product, it will show how likely a particular customer will be happy with it.
